# NeopianStockScraper
Script to scrape the current ticker prices for all the stocks in your portfolio and alert you when you need to sell.

This uses mechanize, so you need to install it from http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

It also uses BeautifulSoup (bs4), which comes with most modern installations of Debian, Ubuntu, or Fedora. 
If you need to install it, you can get it at http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
